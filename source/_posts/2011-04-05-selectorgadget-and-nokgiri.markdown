Just watched [Railscast Episode 190](http://railscasts.com/episodes/190-screen-scraping-with-nokogiri) in which Ryan Bates demonstrated the use of the [Nokogiri Gem](http://nokogiri.org/) for a screen scraping application. As part of the episode, Ryan also demonstrated the use of [SelectorGadget](http://www.selectorgadget.com/), a browser bookmarklet for exploring CSS styles on a page which is useful in Nokogiri for identifying CSS selectors to use to grab a particular HTML element (or group of elements). I had seen SelectorGadget recommended as a [learning tool for jQuery as well](http://www.technologybo.com/learn-jquery-with-firebug-jquerify-and-selectorgadget-3285.html), and Ryan's screencast was a useful reminder.</p>

Incidently, Nokogiri is used by the [Rspec](http://rspec.info/rails/) and [Cucumber](http://rspec.info/rails/) testing tools for Rails view testing.
